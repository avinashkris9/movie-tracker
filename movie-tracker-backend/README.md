# Personal Movie/TV Tracker

Nothing fancy. Just the same old boring goodreads for movies.

- Angular -Spring Boot app to track movies watched.
- Integration with TheMovieDB for additional movie information.
- Personal version for single user.


I wanted to learn Angular/Spring boot . So this is just a learning project. Besides, I love to keep track of movies I watch and write personal notes. IMDB/Letterboxd are good for sharing with people. This is intend to be a personal version.
